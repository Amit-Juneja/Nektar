For running the application clone this repository & execute this command: `node app.js`

By default the application will run on the 3031 PORT but it can be changed from the code itself since I have provided the constant for the PORT which can be updated easily.

Currently the app uses the example.txt file provided in the attachment. different files an be tested by following the below procedure.

1. Upload the file in the root directory
2. change the fileName constant to the name of the file which has been uploaded.


Thanks!!!
